When Cindy was first getting accustomed to her new body and prosthetics, she found it difficult to get in and out of her car. For instance, when getting in, it was hard to find something steady to grab onto as she sat down on the seat and swung her legs into the car.

The manufacturer is a company that makes adaptive tools for daily living, such as many of the items Cindy uses or has created herself. This tool has three uses in one, although on the manufacturer’s website it’s primarily marketed for the first use: Automotive Standing Aid, Seatbelt Cutter, and Window Breaker. This particular tool therefore joins a suite of tools for exiting cars in an emergency, such as (link: http://www.lifehammer.com/features_instructions.html text: LifeHammer) and (link: http://resqme.com/ text: ResQMe).
