Title: Tweezers and Demitasse Spoon

Text: 

Cindy uses tweezers and (link: http://www.antique-central.com/antique-demitasse-spoons.shtml text: demitasse spoons) for two critical daily uses: selecting jewelry and pills. Cindy is able to fill the pillbox for the month with her hands, but she says if a pill hops into the wrong sub-section and she needs to reorganize, she uses tweezers. And tweezers are best for selecting the pills she needs for the day. When she was trying to find a solution to lifting out pills, she first tried the “spit-and-stick” method, “Well, if I spit on my finger and stick it in, I might get the right pill, I might not. So then I thought: what else might do the job?” 

She uses demitasse spoons for her box of earrings. The spoon can be more precise than the tweezers to get under a particular earring and lift it up. And she has paid close attention to the box that she stores the earrings in: to enable her to tip a pair out, the other covers remain closed. 

But Cindy says she is still searching for tweezers that have wider flatter ends. And the item she really wants is something to help her get her earrings on by herself with one hand. Today she can select her earrings, but she needs her husband to put them in her ears.
