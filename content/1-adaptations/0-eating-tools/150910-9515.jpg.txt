Caption: Studio shot of a brown plastic-handled metal serrated dinner knife situated in an white opaque molded cap that fits precisely on Cindy's residual right hand. The cap sits upright and the knife angles from bottom left to upper right of the screen. The knife is propped against the silicone and a layer of silicone wraps over the fork to hold it in place at the angle that best mimics the angle of a knife in a hand.
