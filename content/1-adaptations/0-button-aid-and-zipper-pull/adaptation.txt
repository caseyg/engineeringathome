Cindy doesn’t quite remember where she got this tool, but she thinks she received it from the rehabilitation hospital where she did months of physical and occupational therapy. But she says she never really used it, and has given up on buttons and zippers at this point. “I am not buying things with buttons and zippers now, and if I have things from before with those, Ken [her husband] helps me.” She says she doesn’t have sufficient hand movement and grasping for the push or pull required for buttoning, or the grasping for zippering. “It was more work than it was worth. If I lived alone, it would be a different story. But now I just ask Ken for help if I need to.”
