Title: Adhesive Wall Hooks

----

Intro:

Cindy wanted to find an adaptive way to open some of her daily jars herself: peanut butter, for instance, or her favorite hand cream. Self-adhesive plastic hooks proved to be the perfect tool.

Cindy lost varying amounts of each of her fingers after her heart attack, but her surgeons were able to preserve some grasping motion in the remaining parts of her hands. She can perform twists and grasping, with her left and non-dominant hand especially, but with far less precision than she was used to. Even on that more capable hand, she has reduced ability to grip due to the shortened length of her thumb and other residual fingers and her natural capabilities with this hand. She has no way to fully encompass the rim of a tight jar lid, for example, or use her thumb to oppose the grip of her fingers. But jars are everywhere in Cindyâ€™s house, and she wanted to find an adaptive way to open some of her daily jars herself: peanut butter, for instance, or her favorite hand cream.

Designed for use on walls for temporary storage, such as college dorm rooms, these wall hooks have a strong adhesive backing as a mount, and a lightweight but strong plastic structure. The hook was small enough for food and cosmetic jars, but big enough for her left hand to grip and turn.
