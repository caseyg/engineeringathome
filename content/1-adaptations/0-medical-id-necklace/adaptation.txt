Title: Medical ID Necklace

----

Text: Cindy wears a medical ID necklace whenever she leaves home, but she doesn’t ever want it to show. “Why would I? But if there is an accident, they’d find it.” The necklace holds a stainless steel tag that indicates her identity and relevant medical conditions for emergency situations. “I didn’t want the stainless steel chain you can get at the drugstore, and the gold one cost a lot of money. So I went to the bead store in town and told the man what I was looking for. I picked these neutral clear glass beads and asked him to put a large (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_(jewelry) text: bail) on the tag so any chain would go through it.” But the bead-store owner had a better idea with this large (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster_clasp text: lobster clasp). “I wanted a clasp that was large enough so I could change chains. If I’m ‘fanced up,’ I can put on a gold necklace, even if the tag part is tucked in.” The beaded version or the ‘fanced up’ version, both subtly peek through at her neck, not calling out to observers that it is crucial part of a medical alert system.
