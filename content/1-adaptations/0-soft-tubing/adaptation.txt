Title: Soft Tubing

----

Text: These (link: http://www.rehabmart.com/product/foam-tubing-7753.html text: soft grip tubes) are commonly used for school children who are learning to write with a standard size pencil. The tubes are soft foam and slip resistant; sliding them over a pencil creates a grippy texture and a wider tool to grasp at once. For Cindy, who has a customized pen, these tubes were useful in another context: applying makeup herself. So many of her self-care jobs already require her husband’s assistance, so Cindy wanted to take back this task in her daily routine. The tubes are the perfect size for things like eyeliner. She recalls that the solution came from a male intern at her rehab hospital. The hospital gave her this tubing for using with utensils. But she was discussing with her rehab team how to apply eyeliner. “This young man said ‘makeup, I’m out,’ and began to walk away, but not before he suggested this tubing. He had no experience with eyeliner but was able to think about the tricky holding maneuver.”
