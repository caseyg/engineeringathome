Caption: A close up of Cindy using the 3D printed fingers to wrap a gift, in white tissue paper. The fingers are attached to her hand via a woven elastic bandage on her wrists. The tips of three of Cindy's residual fingers are poking through the finger holes, and the tiny crystal decorative element is visible on each digit. The white food-grade silicone, enabling some flexibility and grip,  fills the ends of each digit.
