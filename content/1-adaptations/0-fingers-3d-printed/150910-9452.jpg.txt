Caption: A close up of a custom prosthetic tool built by Olin college students: a stretchy band of ace bandage with three 3D printed digits attached to it by elastic straps. But the digits are not like human fingers; they're extensions with flat pads to make for simple gripping, steadying, and manipulating, as for newspaper pages. Each finger hole for the digits, suited for Cindy's hands, is ringed with tiny crystals.
