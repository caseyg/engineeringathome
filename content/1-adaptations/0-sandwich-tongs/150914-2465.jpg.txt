Caption: The salad tongs in use, gripping a sandwich half on a plate. The square hold makes it possible for Cindy to tune the openness between tongs, adjustable to the type of food and size of bite. The small size of the whole tool makes it possible get food from the plate to the mouth without undue awkward distance.
