Caption: Cindy using the salad tongs. She is in her kitchen and smiling at the camera, wearing a turquoise shirt. Her left hand is holding the tongs, to show us how they grip the sandwich half. The sandwich, on white bread, has one bite out of it. The other half of the sandwich is on a flowered plate on the table in front of Cindy.
