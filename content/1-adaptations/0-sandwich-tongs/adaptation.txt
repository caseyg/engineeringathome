Title: Sandwich Tongs

Cindy now has a (link: /adaptations/eating-tools text: fork and knife) with customized holders. But what about foods that require a pincer grasp, like sandwiches? 

“If you hand me a sandwich, I can’t put it down. I have to eat the whole thing in one go, no conversation while we eat. So I thought, ‘I need something that would just hold the sandwich, so I can pick it up, put it down, pick it up, put it down.’” At first Cindy thought of using a “chip clip,” a big plastic clip that can be used to reseal a potato chip bag. But “the chip clip didn’t open wide enough. It was a great idea but it didn’t open. Then I thought of cooking tongs.”

So she started exploring online. She thought—“They would need a locking mechanism, so I can lock the sandwich in. But I couldn’t find them small enough. I searched and searched”—and then she found these (link: http://www.currentcatalog.com/product/colorful-kitchen-mini-spatula-tongs-612426.do text: super small ones). These tongs are easy to carry around in her purse, grasp a sandwich securely, and have short enough arms to be able to lift the food to her mouth. “These can get the whole cheeseburger in the tongs, and then I can eat around it. With a BLT, the bacon doesn’t fall out. The lettuce and tomato don’t slip out.”

We think of these tongs in the “appropriation” category—using a tool built for one use in an adaptive new way, without the need for a formal new object.
