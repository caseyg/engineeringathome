Title: Hand Clip

Getting dressed on her own is critical to Cindy’s well being, and at first she couldn’t do much of it. “I was googling ‘upper-limb amputation’ to find tips for myself. Getting dressed was a task to conquer. I don’t want to ask somebody else to do any of these things because there are enough things I have to ask help for, so the things that are possible to do, I should do.” 

She could only apply deodorant to her right side, because it was only her left hand that has sufficient gripping movement. In her Internet searches, she found a YouTube video of a man with no hands getting dressed. “He would put the deodorant on top of the dresser and moved his body around it.” But she also found something like this (link: http://www.rehabmart.com/product/universal-hand-clip-18618.html text: universal hand clip) on an adaptive equipment website, and now uses that. “But just today I essentially had to do what the YouTube guy does because the deodorant had run out and I needed Ken to put the new stick in the holder, but he wasn’t home. So I moved my body around the stick.”
