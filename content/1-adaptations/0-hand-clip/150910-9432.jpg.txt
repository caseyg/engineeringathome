Caption: Studio shot of a yellow stick of roll-on deodorant,  with a holder wrapped around it. The holder consists of a white velcro strap wrapped around the stick, and a protruding piece of black metal that forms a loop and is attached to the velcro with screws. The metal loop holder comes out from the stick at an angle so the loop rests securely on Cindy's hand as she applies the deodorant.
